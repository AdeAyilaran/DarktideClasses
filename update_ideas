The code follows an MVP format and simply presents the simplest solution that answers the question or solves the problem.  There are a number of things you can do to the code to either make it more succinct, 
or provide more functionality.  Here are a few examples:

1. Not repeating code

The block:

health_zero = [character.health for character in (ally + enemy)]
    toughness_zero = [character.toughness for character in (ally + enemy)]
    print(colours.BLACK + f"All Health: {health_zero}")
    print(colours.BLACK + f"All Toughness: {toughness_zero}")
    if 0.0 in health_zero:
        print("Someone has died!")
        print("Game Over!")
        break
        
Can be turned into a function:

def battle_stats(characters):
    health_zero = [character.health for character in characters]
    toughness_zero = [character.toughness for character in characters]
    print(bcolors.BLACK + f"All Health: {health_zero}")
    print(bcolors.BLACK + f"All Toughness: {toughness_zero}")
    if 0.0 in health_zero:
        print("Someone died!")
        return True
    return False
    
And then:

if battle_stats(ally + enemy):
        break

can be used to check if True or False.
